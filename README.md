<br/>

Anyone who has a Google account can simply create a shop app by signing into the shopitect app.
<br/><br/>

Each shop app has a unique URL name (Shop Url Name) that is added when creating the shop app.
###### Shop Url Name in Create page :-
<div align="center" >
<img src="./public/readme-img/create-page.webp" width="500px" />
</div>
<br/>

All generated shop apps are accessible through the browser URL by using the Shop Url Name.

To access a shop app, add the Shop Url Name after the root URL(shopitect.vercel.app).
<br/>
eg: <em><a href="https://shopitect.vercel.app/my-shop" >shopitect.vercel.app/my-shop</a></em>
<br/>
Here 'my-shop' is the unique Shop Url Name.
<br/>
<br/>

Generated shop apps are simple apps that can store the details of products in the shop in a digital form.
<br/>
###### (1) Product Add page, (2) Product Table page :-
<div align="center" >
<img src="./public/readme-img/product-add-page.webp" width="500px" />
<img src="./public/readme-img/product-table-page.webp" width="500px" />
</div>
<br/>
<br/>

This shop app can also use as a small e-commerce website to simply show the details of products to the shop clients.
